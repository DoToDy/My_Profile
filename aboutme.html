            </p>
            <p>I enjoyed watching animations, looking at art listening to music, and was always in awe at how can someone make these things a reality, i then realised that this is also something i would want to do, to create something that others could enjoyed. And so, i found myself
             on this path, improving at my own pace, hopefully making someone be in awe and inspired the same way i was.</p>
             <p>I believe that Watching, Appreciating, Listening and Playing various sorts of content and genres enlights one's spark of creativity, along the way finding certain media's you enjoy more than others. This can define the things you want to create for yourself or for others. </p>
             <p>Some of my hobbies include drawing and collecting various things, I also sometimes draw concepts for a Roblox game called Doodle World.</p>
